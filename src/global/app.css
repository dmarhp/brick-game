/*
  Global App CSS (Document Level Styles)
  ----------------------
  Use this file for styles that should be applied to all components.
  For example, "font-family" within the "body" selector is a CSS property
  most apps will want applied to all components.

  Any global CSS variables should also be applied here.
*/

/*
  The imports below are needed to include our light dom css for global styles such as fonts and colors.
  You can comment out any of these imports if you do not need that css. For example, if you have your own
  global font family css then you can comment out the typography.css import.
